Nicholas keeps using my boots of hermes to justify that we're at equal strength in the game. (even tho
this mf has a musket), I can't wait to use magic in this game.

We need to defeat the Eye of Cthulhu

Update1: Nicholas and I have just defeated the wall of flesh and enabled hard mode.

Update2: We have started mining for cobalt and orichalcum. Adamantite has not been spotted yet. I received a new bow and yoyo. Current bank account is 91 gold (I am rich.)

Plan3: destroy more altars in order to spawn in more hardmode ore, kill slime queen and begin preparing for the mechanical bosses.
