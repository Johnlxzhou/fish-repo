Nicholas keeps using my boots of hermes to justify that we're at equal strength in the game. (even tho
this mf has a musket), I can't wait to use magic in this game.

We need to defeat the Eye of Cthulhu

Update1: Nicholas and I have just defeated the wall of flesh and enabled hard mode.

Update2: We have started mining for cobalt and orichalcum. Adamantite has not been spotted yet. I received a new bow and yoyo. Current bank account is 91 gold (I am rich.)

Plan3: destroy more altars in order to spawn in more hardmode ore, kill slime queen and begin preparing for the mechanical bosses.

Update3: altars destroyed, more ores found. Queen Slime and all mechanical bosses killed. Orichalcum set acquired. True Night's Edge acquire along with other new gear. Able to beat hallow mimic now. We require more Hallow bars and soul of light. Space has been reached, no wyverns,
