Start of Terraria: Nicholas keeps using my boots of hermes to justify that we're at equal strength in the game. (even tho
this mf has a musket), I can't wait to use magic in this game.

Plan1: We need to defeat the Eye of Cthulhu

Update1: Nicholas and I have just defeated the wall of flesh and enabled hard mode.

Update2: We have started mining for cobalt and orichalcum. Adamantite has not been spotted yet. I received a new bow and yoyo. Current bank account is 91 gold (I am rich.)

Plan3: destroy more altars in order to spawn in more hardmode ore, kill slime queen and begin preparing for the mechanical bosses.

Update3: altars destroyed, more ores found. Queen Slime and all mechanical bosses killed. Orichalcum set acquired. True Night's Edge acquire along with other new gear. Able to beat hallow mimic now. We require more Hallow bars and soul of light. Space has been reached, no wyverns,

plan4: find plantera and beat her, find wyverns and get soul of flight for better wings, get more hallow from mechanical bosses and defeat wall of flesh to get emblems

Update4: Gained a new light pet and chlorophite armor. Cleared the rest of the Skeletron Dungeon. Beat plantera, purified enough corruption to gain new NPCs such as the steampunker. Created teleporters to the jungle biome. Defeated a pirate invasion. Nicholas gained a pigmy staff and a seedling pet.

plan5: get a shark fin for mini-shark. Create a mushroom biome for the truffle and get auto-hammer for hoverboard. Activate a blood moon if shark fin is still needed.
